#   for controller based user interaction, i.e. using controllers to browse
#   the web, pause netflix, or in advanced cases, act as a proper controller
#   emulator for video games that lack controller support.


#   Main is the primary application loop and consists of an always active
#   while loop. This loop is only exited on application close events, with
#   the assumption being that if you have the application open, you're either
#   using a controller, or about to connect one.
