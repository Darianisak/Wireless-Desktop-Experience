# Scroll functionality is.. strange.  As scrolling is tied to the right joystick,
# the polling rate of the controller is multiplicative with the scroll rate.
# However, it seems that the lowest accepted rate is around 0.0085, anything
# below this will cause scrolling to not occur. Adjust this value carefully.

# For defining autofill shortcuts, ensure that each letter is separated by a '+'
# symbol and that the string is encapsulated within single quotes. Changing these

# Dead zones define the minimum amount of distance a joystick must be displaced
# from center before movement is recorded. The below variables allow the left
# and right dead zone values to be manually configured. By default, controllers
# are set to around 7498, however the application uses a default of between
# 1300 and 1200 for increased responsiveness. I strongly recommend not going
# below this range as the drag increases dramatically.

# Left dead zone - index 24

# Right dead zone - index 25

# Minimum trigger depression values modify the point at which trigger related

# Scroll speed is handled via displacement ramping, where different intervals
